## The Idea

An inexpensive and small station that helps users sort waste into categories like glass, paper, cardboard, textile, e-waste, plastics, and metal — all highly recyclable yet often discarded improperly.

## The Challenges

In developed countries, a [**large portion of landfill waste is recyclable**](https://www.bookcleango.com/blog/recycling-statistics), with estimates ranging from **30% to 75%** depending on the region and material type.  
The main barriers include [contamination, improper sorting, lack of recycling infrastructure, and consumer behavior](https://github.com/al3xsus/AI-powered-waste-sorting-station/blob/main/why.md).

_The 10 Rs framework — strategies for achieving a circular economy._

An AI-powered waste sorting station can address these challenges by automating and improving the sorting process.

## Examples

One example is the zero-waste town of **Kamikatsu, Japan**. According to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2022/japan-zero-carbon-village-climate/):

> The Zero Waste Center is the town’s recycling facility, where residents can sort their garbage into 45 categories — there are nine ways to sort paper products alone — before they toss the rest into a pile for the incinerators. Residents clean and dry dirty items so they are suitable for recycling.

Another is **Osaki town**, also in Japan.

These examples are inspiring but rely heavily on citizen discipline. The AI-powered waste sorting station aims to provide guidance to make such systems feasible elsewhere.

## The Concept

A **corner-shop-sized** station located in areas with high foot traffic — large housing complexes, malls, or supermarkets — where people can conveniently bring their waste.

Restrictions:

- No bulky items like dishwashers or fridges.
- No organic/biodegradable waste (to avoid pests).
- Assumes plastic bottles, aluminum cans, and glass bottles are handled via deposit schemes (e.g., Pfand).

[![Bottle return machines at supermarkets](https://www.how-to-germany.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pfand-supermarkets-germany.webp "Bottle return machines at supermarkets")](https://www.how-to-germany.com/pfand-in-germany/)
_Deposit-return machines are common in countries with Pfand-like systems._

Funding could come from:

- Government subsidies
- Proceeds from selling salvaged goods in second-hand shops

The expectation is that users bring only dry and clean waste.

## The Machine

Constructed from recycled components:

- **Display** – salvaged TV or laptop screen
- **Microphones** – from laptops
- **Speakers** – from TVs or laptops
- **Cameras** – from laptops, tablets, smartphones
- **Optical sensors** – from scanners
- **Weight sensors** – from digital scales
- **Magnetic sensors** – from hard drives or speakers
- **RFID/NFC sensors** – from smartphones
- **Motherboard** – from smartphones, tablets, laptops, or PCs

_Many hardware parts can be salvaged and reused in the station._

### Designated Areas

1. Information zone (speakers + display)
2. General Item Sorting Table (cameras, optical sensors, weight sensors)
3. Magnetic Sensors Table (ferrous metal detection)
4. NFC/RFID Table (tag detection)

_An AI-generated concept design for the waste sorting station._

## The Algorithm

**Step 1: Arrival & Setup**

- User approaches with waste.
- Station greets them and shows categories/instructions.

**Step 2: Waste Identification**

- AI camera scans items.

**Step 3: Sorting**

- Item placed on sorting table.
- AI determines material & category.
- Ambiguous items go to dedicated analysis areas.

**Step 4: Completion**

- Summary shown to user.
- Data sent to server.
- User rewarded with eco/green points.

If confused, the user can ask the station for help — the query is sent to AGI or a human operator, and the answer is shown and voiced.

## The End

If you think this idea is good — throw dollars at me.
