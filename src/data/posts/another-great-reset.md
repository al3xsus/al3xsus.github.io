You’ve probably heard about the [Great Reset](https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/) — or at least seen memes about it.  
But here’s my proposal for a _real_ reset: one that actually addresses the root problems.

## The Problem with the Current Agenda

Yes, the WEF’s goals — greener living, smarter growth — sound good. But they don’t address the root of the problem, and they don’t “reset” much.

![Meme about the Great Reset](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*Oo18Z5Ofiq6oj4x0.jpg)  
_The Great Reset meme — internet culture has embraced and parodied the concept._

## Why We Must Return to the Big Water

We should rebuild our way of life around **big navigable rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans**.

![WEF 2030 prediction screenshot](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*A8MxCaBQ77vrS5qa.jpg)  
_The “You will own nothing and be happy” narrative — another source of debate and memes._

Reasons:

- Vital water supply for agriculture, industry, and daily life
- Desalination as a solvable challenge
- Essential shipping routes for cargo and passengers
- Recreational and tourism potential
- [Aquaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture) to feed growing populations

## Rethinking City Locations

Cities without access to major water sources should be **abandoned or repurposed**.  
Examples: Soviet-era cities in the steppe built for a single industry.

Vacated land can be:

- Forests, parks, reserves
- Wildlife sanctuaries
- Indigenous territories

Sustainable cities should:

- Grow bigger, stronger, and taller
- Be built as **waterfront stripes** or on islands/floating structures

_Megaregions of the USA — many have stronger ties to regions across borders._

## Economic and Cultural Ties Over Borders

Borders often hinder natural economic flows.  
Some cities should:

- Become city-states
- Merge with nearby regions across borders
- Break away from unsuitable national structures

See: [Megaregions of the USA](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-megaregions-driving-the-global-economy/)

## New Architecture

- Arcologies and mega-towers
- Use local and recycled materials
- Maintain high-rise living standards equal to private homes
- Encourage **urban rooftop gardens**

![Urban garden rooftops](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*qgqt3WUhNnJy4c6m.jpg)  
_Urban gardens on rooftops improve sustainability and city livability._

## New Workplaces and Economies

- Strengthen green and [blue economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_economy)
- Build or upgrade airports, railroads, ports
- Increase business opportunities via population density near coasts

![Blue economy jobs](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*iObcgLVlsfDdKEW2.jpg)  
_Examples of blue economy-related industries._

## New Food

We must diversify crops and seafood:

> “75% of the global food supply comes from only 12 plant and five animal species” — [WWF Report](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-02/Knorr_Future_50_Report_FINAL_Online.pdf)

![Food diversity chart](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*LpA8NZW8A-tP3YgW.jpg)  
_Diversity in food crops is essential for long-term sustainability._

## More Recycling, Reusing, and Reducing

- Use plastics only for special purposes
- Turn biodegradable waste into biogas and fertilizer
- Encourage conscious consumption
- [More on reuse vs recycling](https://sites.psu.edu/aspsy/2020/02/06/is-reusing-the-new-recycling/)

![Recycling bins](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*vJqGeKKiCfe2OVFr.jpg)  
_More “R” — rethink, reduce, reuse, recycle, and repair._

## New Ways of Manufacturing

- Build products locally with local materials
- Use CNC machines, 3D printers, and modern manufacturing tools
- Reduce dependence on imports

## Challenges and Flaws

1. Risk of conflict over new borders
2. Bureaucratic restrictions (e.g., UN ban on artificial island states)
3. Ecological impacts of increased coastal populations
4. Technological challenges (e.g., corrosion from saltwater)
5. Sea-level rise and climate change impacts
6. Overpopulation in some suitable cities
7. Natural hazards (e.g., tsunamis, rogue waves)

## Conclusion

This Great Reset plan focuses on sustainable urban planning, resource management, and economic realignment — rooted in living with and from the water.
